# Centralized Error Handling Middleware
This project provides a centralized error handling mechanism for a Node/Express application. The error handling is performed using a middleware that receives all errors thrown by the application and returns a custom error message along with a relevant HTTP status code. If any errors go unhandled, a default internal server error (HTTP 500) with a custom message is assigned.

The errors are also logged using Winston logger and stored in a file. The logs are automatically deleted after 3 days. This system helps to provide consistent, structured, and comprehensive error handling and reporting in the application.

Additionally, the project opens a swagger documentation (http://localhost:3000/api-docs) which displays all the available requests, their description, and the methods.
